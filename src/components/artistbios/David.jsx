            <h2>Hey, Im David </h2>
            <p>
            I became a professional photographer after spending years as a peer counselor for justice-involved veterans in the Austin area. 
            As an army veteran myself, my love for photography started while I was deployed in Afghanistan.
            The landscape and people around me were unlike anything Iâ€™d seen or experienced growing up in the Texas Hill Country. 
            Since then, photography has been my creative outlet and personal therapy, capturing the world through my own lens.
