                I started taking photos, because I like looking at stuff. Some stuff about going to school for Radio / TV / Film, and learning photography to get better at lighting and shooting video. Ended up switching mainly to photography because the gear was lighter, and ended up shooting professionally. I am horible at writing about myself.
